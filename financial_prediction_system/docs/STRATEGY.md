# Documentation Strategy Plan

## Documentation Framework

Our documentation follows the Diátaxis framework (https://diataxis.fr/) which organizes content into four quadrants:

1. **Tutorials** - Learning-oriented, hands-on lessons for beginners
2. **How-To Guides** - Problem-oriented, practical steps for specific tasks
3. **Reference** - Information-oriented, technical descriptions of components
4. **Explanation** - Understanding-oriented, clarification of concepts

## Documentation Guidelines

### Style Guide
- Use active voice and present tense
- Target a technical but non-specialist audience
- Include images/screenshots for complex visualizations
- Use consistent terminology across all documents
- Keep tutorials focused on concrete outcomes
- Keep how-to guides focused on specific tasks
- Keep reference documentation comprehensive but concise
- Keep explanations focused on concepts, not procedures
