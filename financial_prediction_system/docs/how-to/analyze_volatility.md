# How to Analyze Stock Volatility

This guide will walk you through the steps to analyze a stock's volatility using the Financial Prediction System.

## Overview

Volatility analysis helps you understand the magnitude of price movements and risk in a stock. This guide shows how to use the volatility tools in the EDA section.

## Steps

### 1. Access the Volatility Analysis Tab

- Navigate to the EDA page
- Select your stock and date range
- Click on the "Volatility Analysis" tab

### 2. Analyze Rolling Volatility

Use the rolling volatility chart to identify periods of high and low volatility:

- Observe the standard deviation of returns over different time windows
- Compare 10-day, 20-day and 30-day volatility lines
- Identify volatility clusters and trends

### 3. Examine the Volatility Cone

The volatility cone shows how volatility tends to change with time:

- Look at minimum, maximum, and average volatility across different time horizons
- Use this to understand the term structure of volatility
- Identify when current volatility is abnormally high or low for a given time horizon

### 4. Interpret Volatility Regimes

The regime classification chart segments the time series into different volatility states:

- Low volatility (green): Stable price action
- Medium volatility (yellow): Moderate price fluctuations
- High volatility (red): Large price swings

### 5. Compare Price and Volatility

The price and volatility comparison chart helps identify relationships:

- Does volatility increase during price drops? (leverage effect)
- Is there a volatility trend independent of price?
- Are there predictable volatility patterns?

## Troubleshooting

- **Missing Data**: If charts appear empty, try selecting a larger date range
- **Inconsistent Results**: Ensure you're looking at the same time period across all charts
