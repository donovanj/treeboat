# Getting Started with Exploratory Data Analysis

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to perform your first EDA on financial data using our system.

## What You'll Build

By the end of this tutorial, you'll have created your first stock analysis using several visualization techniques:
- A candlestick chart showing price movement
- A histogram of daily returns
- A basic volatility analysis

## Prerequisites
- System access with login credentials
- Basic understanding of stock market concepts

## Step 1: Accessing the EDA Page

1. Log in to the Financial Prediction System
2. Navigate to the "EDA" option in the main navigation menu
3. You should now see the EDA interface with the stock selector

## Step 2: Selecting a Stock and Time Period

1. Use the StockAutocomplete component to search for a stock (e.g., "AAPL")
2. Select your desired date range using the DateRangePicker
3. Click "Load Data" to retrieve the stock information

## Step 3: Exploring the Overview Tab

The Overview tab provides a high-level analysis of the selected stock:

1. **Candlestick Chart**: Shows daily price movement
   - Green candles indicate days where the closing price was higher than the opening price
   - Red candles indicate days where the closing price was lower than the opening price

2. **Trendlines**: Observe both linear and non-linear trends in the data
   - The linear trendline shows the overall direction
   - The non-linear trendline adjusts to local patterns

3. **Histogram of Daily Returns**: Displays the distribution of price changes
   - Most returns cluster around 0%
   - The "fat tails" show extreme price movements

## Step 4: Interpreting Your First Analysis

1. Look at the candlestick pattern for signs of:
   - Uptrends or downtrends
   - Periods of consolidation (sideways movement)
   - Significant price gaps

2. Check the histogram for:
   - Symmetry (are gains and losses equally likely?)
   - Outliers (unusual price movements)
